    Viewing distance matters: Higher PPI is only noticeable if you're close enough to perceive the difference.
    Most desktop monitors and laptops don't exceed ~220 PPI because beyond that, the improvement in clarity is minimal for standard viewing distances.
    Ultra-high PPIs (300+) are typically reserved for smartphones or small displays where the viewing distance is closer."""
